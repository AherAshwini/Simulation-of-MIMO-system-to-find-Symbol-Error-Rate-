# Simulation-of-MIMO-system-to-find-Symbol-Error-Rate-
Implemented 2X1 and 2X2 MIMO systems using MATLAB. 
Applied Jakeâ€™s fading simulator to generate Rayleigh fading channels for both the systems and generated Alamouti code.
Plotted Symbol Error Rate (SER) vs Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) curve for both the systems.
